The Project consist of the use of a python library(socket) to build a simple webclient(browser) and a simple server.
This demonstrates the process of http request/responds between both sockets and how they connect
INSTRUCTIONS

1: Run the Server in a Separate Terminal Window
Run the server in one terminal window:

Open a command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell window.
Navigate to your project directory and run the server:

python server.py

The server should display "Server is listening on port 9000..." and then wait for client connections.

2:Run the client in a separate terminal window:

Open another CMD or PowerShell window.
Navigate to the same project directory and run the client:

python client1.py

This way, the server will continue running in the first terminal, and the client will run in the second terminal, with the output showing the response from the server.
